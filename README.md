# RoboticRangers

This page showcase the project work of Alan Wicht, Kento Jousson, Marin Bricq and Mentor Tafili for the course Basics of Mobile Robotics, given at EPFL by Prof. Mondada.

The goal of the project was to work on a Thymio robot such that it would be able to move in a filmed environment and reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. Furthermore, the robot is able to relocate itself even if it is kidnapped during its trajectory.

The file `Report.ipynb` explains in more detail the whole system and explains the how the code works. The following video is displaying the project in action:
